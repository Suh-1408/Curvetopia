# Curvetopia

Curvetopia is a comprehensive project aimed at identifying, regularizing, and beautifying 2D curves. The project processes polylines to fit and smooth shapes like circles, ellipses, polygons, and Bézier curves, providing tools to handle isolated and fragmented curves, detect symmetry, and complete incomplete curves.

--This project was created  as a part of "ADOBE GENSOLVE 2024".

## Objective

The objective of Curvetopia is to:

1. **Regularize Curves**: Fit and simplify curves to regular shapes including straight lines, circles, ellipses, polygons, and Bézier curves.
2. **Detect Symmetry**: Identify symmetrical shapes and structures within the set of curves.
3. **Complete Incomplete Curves**: Use computer vision techniques to fill gaps in curves caused by occlusions or incomplete data.

## Problem Description

The project begins by working with polylines defined by sequences of points. The goal is to output curves as connected sequences of cubic Bézier curves. 

**For visualization,** we use SVG format for rendering and compare the results with the expected outputs.

## Features

- **Regularize Curves**: Fit shapes like circles, ellipses, polygons, and Bézier curves.
- **Detect Symmetry**: Analyze curves to find symmetrical structures.
- **Complete Incomplete Curves**: Use techniques to complete curves that have gaps.
